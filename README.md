# Readme

This repository contains my trials of the Garmin SDK.
For installation follow the instructions on https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/ (for installing both the SDK and the MonkeyC extension in VS code).

If you are on Linux you may have to start the SDK manager using
```
env WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 ./sdkmanager
```
